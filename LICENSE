### **English Version**

**GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE**
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. [https://fsf.org/](https://fsf.org/)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

**Preamble**

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**0. Definitions.**

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

**1. Source Code.**

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

**2. Basic Permissions.**

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

**3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

**6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.**

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

**7. Additional Terms.**

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

**8. Termination.**

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

**9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

**10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

**11. Patents.**

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

**12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.**

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

**13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

**14. Revised Versions of this License.**

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

**15. Disclaimer of Warranty.**

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**16. Limitation of Liability.**

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.**

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

**END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

> You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

> LibraSign Copyright (C) 2025 Heitor Câmara Costa Fernandes
>
> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w\`.
>
> This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type \`show c\` for details.

The hypothetical commands \`show w\` and \`show c\` should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html).

### **Versão em Português (Brasil)**

**LICENÇA PÚBLICA GERAL GNU**
Versão 3, 29 de Junho de 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. [https://fsf.org/](https://fsf.org/)

É permitida a cópia e distribuição de cópias literais deste documento de licença, mas sua alteração não é permitida.

**Preâmbulo**

A Licença Pública Geral GNU é uma licença livre, copyleft, para software e outros tipos de obras.

As licenças para a maioria dos softwares e outras obras práticas são projetadas para retirar sua liberdade de compartilhar e alterar as obras. Em contraste, a Licença Pública Geral GNU destina-se a garantir sua liberdade de compartilhar e alterar todas as versões de um programa — para garantir que ele permaneça como software livre para todos os seus usuários. Nós, a Free Software Foundation, usamos a Licença Pública Geral GNU para a maioria de nossos softwares; ela também se aplica a qualquer outra obra liberada desta forma por seus autores. Você também pode aplicá-la aos seus programas.

Quando falamos de software livre, estamos nos referindo à liberdade, não ao preço. Nossas Licenças Públicas Gerais são projetadas para garantir que você tenha a liberdade de distribuir cópias de software livre (e cobrar por elas, se desejar), que você receba o código-fonte ou possa obtê-lo se quiser, que você possa alterar o software ou usar partes dele em novos programas livres, e que você saiba que pode fazer essas coisas.

Para proteger seus direitos, precisamos impedir que outros neguem esses direitos a você ou peçam que você renuncie a eles. Portanto, você tem certas responsabilidades se distribuir cópias do software ou se o modificar: responsabilidades de respeitar a liberdade dos outros.

Por exemplo, se você distribuir cópias de tal programa, seja gratuitamente ou por uma taxa, você deve repassar aos destinatários as mesmas liberdades que recebeu. Você deve garantir que eles também recebam ou possam obter o código-fonte. E você deve mostrar a eles estes termos para que conheçam seus direitos.

Desenvolvedores que usam a GNU GPL protegem seus direitos em duas etapas: (1) afirmam os direitos autorais sobre o software e (2) oferecem a você esta Licença, dando-lhe permissão legal para copiá-lo, distribuí-lo e/ou modificá-lo.

Para a proteção dos desenvolvedores e autores, a GPL explica claramente que não há garantia para este software livre. Para o bem de ambos, usuários e autores, a GPL exige que as versões modificadas sejam marcadas como alteradas, para que seus problemas não sejam atribuídos erroneamente aos autores de versões anteriores.

Alguns dispositivos são projetados para negar aos usuários o acesso para instalar ou executar versões modificadas do software dentro deles, embora o fabricante possa fazê-lo. Isso é fundamentalmente incompatível com o objetivo de proteger a liberdade dos usuários de alterar o software. O padrão sistemático de tal abuso ocorre na área de produtos para uso individual, que é precisamente onde é mais inaceitável. Portanto, projetamos esta versão da GPL para proibir essa prática para esses produtos. Se tais problemas surgirem substancialmente em outros domínios, estamos prontos para estender esta disposição a esses domínios em futuras versões da GPL, conforme necessário para proteger a liberdade dos usuários.

Finalmente, todo programa é constantemente ameaçado por patentes de software. Os Estados não deveriam permitir que patentes restrinjam o desenvolvimento e o uso de software em computadores de uso geral, mas naqueles que o fazem, desejamos evitar o perigo especial de que as patentes aplicadas a um programa livre possam torná-lo efetivamente proprietário. Para evitar isso, a GPL garante que as patentes não possam ser usadas para tornar o programa não-livre.

Os termos e condições precisos para cópia, distribuição e modificação seguem abaixo.

**TERMOS E CONDIÇÕES**

**0. Definições.**

"Esta Licença" refere-se à versão 3 da Licença Pública Geral GNU.

"Direito Autoral" também significa leis análogas aos direitos autorais que se aplicam a outros tipos de obras, como máscaras de semicondutores.

"O Programa" refere-se a qualquer obra protegida por direito autoral licenciada sob esta Licença. Cada licenciado é tratado como "você". "Licenciados" e "destinatários" podem ser indivíduos ou organizações.

"Modificar" uma obra significa copiar ou adaptar toda ou parte da obra de uma forma que exija permissão de direito autoral, que não seja a criação de uma cópia exata. A obra resultante é chamada de "versão modificada" da obra anterior ou uma obra "baseada na" obra anterior.

Uma "obra coberta" significa tanto o Programa não modificado quanto uma obra baseada no Programa.

"Propagar" uma obra significa fazer qualquer coisa com ela que, sem permissão, o tornaria direta ou secundariamente responsável por infração sob a lei de direito autoral aplicável, exceto executá-la em um computador ou modificar uma cópia privada. A propagação inclui cópia, distribuição (com ou sem modificação), disponibilização ao público e, em alguns países, outras atividades também.

"Transmitir" uma obra significa qualquer tipo de propagação que permita a outras partes fazer ou receber cópias. A mera interação com um usuário através de uma rede de computadores, sem a transferência de uma cópia, não é transmissão.

Uma interface de usuário interativa exibe "Avisos Legais Apropriados" na medida em que inclui um recurso conveniente e proeminentemente visível que (1) exibe um aviso de direito autoral apropriado e (2) informa ao usuário que não há garantia para a obra (exceto na medida em que garantias são fornecidas), que os licenciados podem transmitir a obra sob esta Licença, e como visualizar uma cópia desta Licença. Se a interface apresentar uma lista de comandos ou opções do usuário, como um menu, um item proeminente na lista atende a este critério.

**1. Código-Fonte.**

O "código-fonte" de uma obra significa a forma preferencial da obra para fazer modificações nela. "Código-objeto" significa qualquer forma não-fonte de uma obra.

Uma "Interface Padrão" significa uma interface que é um padrão oficial definido por um órgão de padronização reconhecido ou, no caso de interfaces especificadas para uma linguagem de programação particular, uma que é amplamente utilizada entre os desenvolvedores que trabalham nessa linguagem.

As "Bibliotecas do Sistema" de uma obra executável incluem qualquer coisa, exceto a obra como um todo, que (a) está incluída na forma normal de empacotamento de um Componente Principal, mas que não faz parte desse Componente Principal, e (b) serve apenas para permitir o uso da obra com aquele Componente Principal, ou para implementar uma Interface Padrão para a qual uma implementação está disponível ao público em forma de código-fonte. Um "Componente Principal", neste contexto, significa um componente essencial principal (kernel, sistema de janelas, etc.) do sistema operacional específico (se houver) no qual a obra executável é executada, ou um compilador usado para produzir a obra, ou um interpretador de código-objeto usado для executá-la.

O "Código-Fonte Correspondente" para uma obra em forma de código-objeto significa todo o código-fonte necessário para gerar, instalar e (para uma obra executável) executar o código-objeto e modificar a obra, incluindo scripts para controlar essas atividades. No entanto, não inclui as Bibliotecas do Sistema da obra, ou ferramentas de uso geral ou programas livres geralmente disponíveis que são usados sem modificação na realização dessas atividades, mas que não fazem parte da obra. Por exemplo, o Código-Fonte Correspondente inclui arquivos de definição de interface associados aos arquivos-fonte da obra, e o código-fonte para bibliotecas compartilhadas e subprogramas vinculados dinamicamente que a obra é especificamente projetada para exigir, como por comunicação de dados íntima ou fluxo de controle entre esses subprogramas e outras partes da obra.

O Código-Fonte Correspondente não precisa incluir nada que os usuários possam regenerar automaticamente de outras partes do Código-Fonte Correspondente.

O Código-Fonte Correspondente para uma obra em forma de código-fonte é essa mesma obra.

**2. Permissões Básicas.**

Todos os direitos concedidos sob esta Licença são concedidos pelo prazo do direito autoral sobre o Programa e são irrevogáveis, desde que as condições estabelecidas sejam cumpridas. Esta Licença afirma explicitamente sua permissão ilimitada para executar o Programa não modificado. A saída da execução de uma obra coberta é coberta por esta Licença apenas se a saída, dado seu conteúdo, constituir uma obra coberta. Esta Licença reconhece seus direitos de uso justo ou outro equivalente, conforme previsto pela lei de direito autoral.

Você pode fazer, executar e propagar obras cobertas que você не transmite, sem condições, desde que sua licença permaneça em vigor. Você pode transmitir obras cobertas a outros com o único propósito de que eles façam modificações exclusivamente para você, ou forneçam a você instalações para executar essas obras, desde que você cumpra os termos desta Licença ao transmitir todo o material pelo qual você não detém o direito autoral. Aqueles que, assim, fazem ou executam as obras cobertas para você devem fazê-lo exclusivamente em seu nome, sob sua direção e controle, em termos que os proíbam de fazer quaisquer cópias de seu material protegido por direito autoral fora de seu relacionamento com você.

A transmissão sob quaisquer outras circunstâncias é permitida exclusivamente sob as condições declaradas abaixo. O sublicenciamento não é permitido; a seção 10 o torna desnecessário.

**3. Protegendo os Direitos Legais dos Usuários da Lei Anti-Evasão.**

Nenhuma obra coberta será considerada parte de uma medida tecnológica eficaz sob qualquer lei aplicável que cumpra as obrigações do artigo 11 do tratado de direito autoral da OMPI, adotado em 20 de dezembro de 1996, ou leis similares que proíbam ou restrinjam a evasão de tais medidas.

Ao transmitir uma obra coberta, você renuncia a qualquer poder legal para proibir a evasão de medidas tecnológicas na medida em que tal evasão seja efetuada pelo exercício de direitos sob esta Licença com respeito à obra coberta, e você se isenta de qualquer intenção de limitar a operação ou modificação da obra como um meio de fazer valer, contra os usuários da obra, seus direitos legais ou de terceiros de proibir a evasão de medidas tecnológicas.

**4. Transmissão de Cópias Literais.**

Você pode transmitir cópias literais do código-fonte do Programa como o recebeu, em qualquer meio, desde que publique de forma conspícua e apropriada em cada cópia um aviso de direito autoral apropriado; mantenha intactos todos os avisos que declaram que esta Licença e quaisquer termos não permissivos adicionados de acordo com a seção 7 se aplicam ao código; mantenha intactos todos os avisos de ausência de qualquer garantia; e dê a todos os destinatários uma cópia desta Licença junto com o Programa.

Você pode cobrar qualquer preço ou nenhum preço por cada cópia que transmitir, e pode oferecer suporte ou proteção de garantia por uma taxa.

**5. Transmissão de Versões de Código-Fonte Modificadas.**

Você pode transmitir uma obra baseada no Programa, ou as modificações para produzi-la a partir do Programa, na forma de código-fonte sob os termos da seção 4, desde que também cumpra todas estas condições:

a) A obra deve conter avisos proeminentes declarando que você a modificou e informando uma data relevante.

b) A obra deve conter avisos proeminentes declarando que ela é liberada sob esta Licença e quaisquer condições adicionadas sob a seção 7. Este requisito modifica o requisito da seção 4 de "manter intactos todos os avisos".

c) Você deve licenciar a obra inteira, como um todo, sob esta Licença a qualquer um que entre em posse de uma cópia. Esta Licença, portanto, se aplicará, juntamente com quaisquer termos adicionais da seção 7 aplicáveis, a toda a obra e a todas as suas partes, independentemente de como são empacotadas. Esta Licença não dá permissão para licenciar a obra de qualquer outra forma, mas não invalida tal permissão se você a tiver recebido separadamente.

d) Se a obra tiver interfaces de usuário interativas, cada uma deve exibir os Avisos Legais Apropriados; no entanto, se o Programa tiver interfaces interativas que não exibem os Avisos Legais Apropriados, sua obra não precisa fazer com que o façam.

Uma compilação de uma obra coberta com outras obras separadas e independentes, que não são por sua natureza extensões da obra coberta, e que не são combinadas com ela de forma a formar um programa maior, em ou sobre um volume de um meio de armazenamento ou distribuição, é chamada de "agregado" se a compilação e seu direito autoral resultante не são usados para limitar o acesso ou os direitos legais dos usuários da compilação além do que as obras individuais permitem. A inclusão de uma obra coberta em um agregado não faz com que esta Licença se aplique às outras partes do agregado.

**6. Transmissão de Formas Não-Fonte.**

Você pode transmitir uma obra coberta em forma de código-objeto sob os termos das seções 4 e 5, desde que também transmita o Código-Fonte Correspondente legível por máquina sob os termos desta Licença, de uma destas maneiras:

a) Transmitir o código-objeto em, ou incorporado em, um produto físico (incluindo um meio de distribuição físico), acompanhado pelo Código-Fonte Correspondente fixado em um meio físico durável habitualmente usado para intercâmbio de software.

b) Transmitir o código-objeto em, ou incorporado em, um produto físico (incluindo um meio de distribuição físico), acompanhado por uma oferta por escrito, válida por pelo menos três anos e válida enquanto você oferecer peças de reposição ou suporte ao cliente para esse modelo de produto, para dar a qualquer um que possua o código-objeto (1) uma cópia do Código-Fonte Correspondente para todo o software no produto que é coberto por esta Licença, em um meio físico durável habitualmente usado para intercâmbio de software, por um preço não superior ao seu custo razoável de realizar fisicamente esta transmissão de fonte, ou (2) acesso para copiar o Código-Fonte Correspondente de um servidor de rede sem custo.

c) Transmitir cópias individuais do código-objeto com uma cópia da oferta por escrito para fornecer o Código-Fonte Correspondente. Esta alternativa é permitida apenas ocasionalmente e não comercialmente, e somente se você recebeu o código-objeto com tal oferta, de acordo com a subseção 6b.

d) Transmitir o código-objeto oferecendo acesso de um local designado (gratuito ou por uma taxa), e oferecer acesso equivalente ao Código-Fonte Correspondente da mesma forma através do mesmo local sem custo adicional. Você não precisa exigir que os destinatários copiem o Código-Fonte Correspondente junto com o código-objeto. Se o local para copiar o código-objeto for um servidor de rede, o Código-Fonte Correspondente pode estar em um servidor diferente (operado por você ou por um terceiro) que suporte instalações de cópia equivalentes, desde que você mantenha instruções claras ao lado do código-objeto dizendo onde encontrar o Código-Fonte Correspondente. Independentemente de qual servidor hospeda o Código-Fonte Correspondente, você permanece obrigado a garantir que ele esteja disponível pelo tempo necessário para satisfazer esses requisitos.

e) Transmitir o código-objeto usando transmissão ponto-a-ponto (peer-to-peer), desde que você informe outros pares onde o código-objeto e o Código-Fonte Correspondente da obra estão sendo oferecidos ao público em geral sem custo sob a subseção 6d.

Uma porção separável do código-objeto, cujo código-fonte é excluído do Código-Fonte Correspondente como uma Biblioteca do Sistema, não precisa ser incluída na transmissão da obra de código-objeto.

Um "Produto de Usuário" é (1) um "produto de consumo", que significa qualquer propriedade pessoal tangível que é normalmente usada para fins pessoais, familiares ou domésticos, ou (2) qualquer coisa projetada ou vendida para incorporação em uma moradia. Na determinação se um produto é um produto de consumo, casos duvidosos serão resolvidos em favor da cobertura. Para um produto particular recebido por um usuário particular, "normalmente usado" refere-se a um uso típico ou comum daquela classe de produto, independentemente do status do usuário particular ou da maneira como o usuário particular realmente usa, ou espera ou se espera que use, o produto. Um produto é um produto de consumo, independentemente de o produto ter usos comerciais, industriais ou não-consumidores substanciais, a menos que tais usos representem o único modo significativo de uso do produto.

"Informações de Instalação" para um Produto de Usuário significa quaisquer métodos, procedimentos, chaves de autorização ou outras informações necessárias para instalar e executar versões modificadas de uma obra coberta naquele Produto de Usuário a partir de uma versão modificada de seu Código-Fonte Correspondente. As informações devem ser suficientes para garantir que o funcionamento contínuo do código-objeto modificado não seja em nenhum caso impedido ou interferido apenas porque a modificação foi feita.

Se você transmitir uma obra de código-objeto sob esta seção em, ou com, ou especificamente para uso em, um Produto de Usuário, e a transmissão ocorrer como parte de uma transação na qual o direito de posse e uso do Produto de Usuário é transferido ao destinatário em perpetuidade ou por um prazo fixo (independentemente de como a transação é caracterizada), o Código-Fonte Correspondente transmitido sob esta seção deve ser acompanhado pelas Informações de Instalação. Mas este requisito não se aplica se nem você nem qualquer terceiro mantiver a capacidade de instalar código-objeto modificado no Produto de Usuário (por exemplo, a obra foi instalada em ROM).

O requisito de fornecer Informações de Instalação не inclui a obrigação de continuar a fornecer serviço de suporte, garantia ou atualizações para uma obra que foi modificada ou instalada pelo destinatário, ou para o Produto de Usuário no qual foi modificada ou instalada. O acesso a uma rede pode ser negado quando a modificação em si afeta material e adversamente a operação da rede ou viola as regras e protocolos de comunicação através da rede.

O Código-Fonte Correspondente transmitido e as Informações de Instalação fornecidas, de acordo com esta seção, devem estar em um formato que seja publicamente documentado (e com uma implementação disponível ao público em forma de código-fonte), e não devem exigir senha ou chave especial para descompactar, ler ou copiar.

**7. Termos Adicionais.**

"Permissões adicionais" são termos que complementam os termos desta Licença, fazendo exceções a uma ou mais de suas condições. Permissões adicionais que são aplicáveis a todo o Programa serão tratadas como se estivessem incluídas nesta Licença, na medida em que sejam válidas sob a lei aplicável. Se as permissões adicionais se aplicarem apenas a uma parte do Programa, essa parte pode ser usada separadamente sob essas permissões, mas todo o Programa permanece governado por esta Licença, sem levar em conta as permissões adicionais.

Ao transmitir uma cópia de uma obra coberta, você pode, a seu critério, remover quaisquer permissões adicionais daquela cópia, ou de qualquer parte dela. (Permissões adicionais podem ser escritas para exigir sua própria remoção em certos casos quando você modifica a obra.) Você pode colocar permissões adicionais em material, adicionado por você a uma obra coberta, para o qual você tem ou pode dar permissão de direito autoral apropriada.

Não obstante qualquer outra disposição desta Licença, para material que você adiciona a uma obra coberta, você pode (se autorizado pelos detentores do direito autoral desse material) complementar os termos desta Licença com termos que:

a) Isentam de garantia ou limitam a responsabilidade de forma diferente dos termos das seções 15 e 16 desta Licença; ou

b) Exigem a preservação de avisos legais razoáveis especificados ou atribuições de autor nesse material ou nos Avisos Legais Apropriados exibidos por obras que o contenham; ou

c) Proíbem a deturpação da origem desse material, ou exigem que versões modificadas de tal material sejam marcadas de maneiras razoáveis como diferentes da versão original; ou

d) Limitam o uso para fins publicitários de nomes de licenciadores ou autores do material; ou

e) Recusam a concessão de direitos sob a lei de marcas registradas para o uso de alguns nomes comerciais, marcas registradas ou marcas de serviço; ou

f) Exigem a indenização de licenciadores e autores desse material por qualquer pessoa que transmita o material (ou versões modificadas dele) com suposições contratuais de responsabilidade para com o destinatário, por qualquer responsabilidade que essas suposições contratuais imponham diretamente a esses licenciadores e autores.

Todos os outros termos adicionais não permissivos são considerados "restrições adicionais" no sentido da seção 10. Se o Programa, como você o recebeu, ou qualquer parte dele, contiver um aviso declarando que é governado por esta Licença juntamente com um termo que é uma restrição adicional, você pode remover esse termo. Se um documento de licença contiver uma restrição adicional, mas permitir o relicenciamento ou a transmissão sob esta Licença, você pode adicionar a uma obra coberta material governado pelos termos desse documento de licença, desde que a restrição adicional не sobreviva a tal relicenciamento ou transmissão.

Se você adicionar termos a uma obra coberta de acordo com esta seção, você deve colocar, nos arquivos-fonte relevantes, uma declaração dos termos adicionais que se aplicam a esses arquivos, ou um aviso indicando onde encontrar os termos aplicáveis.

Termos adicionais, permissivos ou não, podem ser declarados na forma de uma licença escrita separadamente, ou declarados como exceções; os requisitos acima se aplicam de qualquer maneira.

**8. Rescisão.**

Você não pode propagar ou modificar uma obra coberta, exceto conforme expressamente previsto nesta Licença. Qualquer tentativa de propagar ou modificá-la de outra forma é nula e rescindirá automaticamente seus direitos sob esta Licença (incluindo quaisquer licenças de patente concedidas sob o terceiro parágrafo da seção 11).

No entanto, se você cessar toda a violação desta Licença, sua licença de um detentor de direito autoral específico será restabelecida (a) provisoriamente, a menos e até que o detentor do direito autoral rescinda explícita e finalmente sua licença, e (b) permanentemente, se o detentor do direito autoral não o notificar da violação por algum meio razoável antes de 60 dias após a cessação.

Além disso, sua licença de um detentor de direito autoral específico é restabelecida permanentemente se o detentor do direito autoral o notificar da violação por algum meio razoável, esta for a primeira vez que você recebeu um aviso de violação desta Licença (para qualquer obra) daquele detentor de direito autoral, e você sanar a violação antes de 30 dias após o recebimento do aviso.

A rescisão de seus direitos sob esta seção не rescinde as licenças das partes que receberam cópias ou direitos de você sob esta Licença. Se seus direitos foram rescindidos e não permanentemente restabelecidos, você не se qualifica para receber novas licenças para o mesmo material sob a seção 10.

**9. Aceitação Não Exigida para Ter Cópias.**

Você не é obrigado a aceitar esta Licença para receber ou executar uma cópia do Programa. A propagação acessória de uma obra coberta que ocorra unicamente como consequência do uso de transmissão ponto-a-ponto para receber uma cópia também не exige aceitação. No entanto, nada além desta Licença lhe concede permissão para propagar ou modificar qualquer obra coberta. Essas ações infringem o direito autoral se você não aceitar esta Licença. Portanto, ao modificar ou propagar uma obra coberta, você indica sua aceitação desta Licença para fazê-lo.

**10. Licenciamento Automático de Destinatários a Jusante.**

Cada vez que você transmite uma obra coberta, o destinatário recebe automaticamente uma licença dos licenciadores originais para executar, modificar e propagar essa obra, sujeita a esta Licença. Você não é responsável por fazer cumprir a conformidade por terceiros com esta Licença.

Uma "transação de entidade" é uma transação que transfere o controle de uma organização, ou substancialmente todos os ativos de uma, ou subdivide uma organização, ou funde organizações. Se a propagação de uma obra coberta resultar de uma transação de entidade, cada parte dessa transação que recebe uma cópia da obra também recebe quaisquer licenças para a obra que o antecessor da parte em interesse tinha ou poderia dar sob o parágrafo anterior, mais um direito à posse do Código-Fonte Correspondente da obra do antecessor em interesse, se o antecessor o tiver ou puder obtê-lo com esforços razoáveis.

Você não pode impor quaisquer restrições adicionais ao exercício dos direitos concedidos ou afirmados sob esta Licença. Por exemplo, você не pode impor uma taxa de licença, royalty ou outra cobrança pelo exercício dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença, e você não pode iniciar um litígio (incluindo uma reconvenção ou contraditório em uma ação judicial) alegando que qualquer reivindicação de patente é infringida ao fazer, usar, vender, oferecer para venda ou importar o Programa ou qualquer parte dele.

**11. Patentes.**

Um "contribuidor" é um detentor de direito autoral que autoriza o uso sob esta Licença do Programa ou de uma obra na qual o Programa se baseia. A obra assim licenciada é chamada de "versão do contribuidor".

As "reivindicações de patente essenciais" de um contribuidor são todas as reivindicações de patente de propriedade ou controladas pelo contribuidor, já adquiridas ou a serem adquiridas, que seriam infringidas por alguma maneira, permitida por esta Licença, de fazer, usar ou vender sua versão de contribuidor, mas não incluem reivindicações que seriam infringidas apenas como consequência de modificação posterior da versão do contribuidor. Para os fins desta definição, "controle" inclui o direito de conceder sublicenças de patente de maneira consistente com os requisitos desta Licença.

Cada contribuidor concede a você uma licença de patente não exclusiva, mundial, isenta de royalties sob as reivindicações de patente essenciais do contribuidor, para fazer, usar, vender, oferecer para venda, importar e, de outra forma, executar, modificar e propagar o conteúdo de sua versão de contribuidor.

Nos três parágrafos seguintes, uma "licença de patente" é qualquer acordo ou compromisso expresso, independentemente da denominação, de não fazer valer uma patente (como uma permissão expressa para praticar uma patente ou um pacto de não processar por infração de patente). "Conceder" tal licença de patente a uma parte significa fazer tal acordo ou compromisso de não fazer valer uma patente contra a parte.

Se você transmitir uma obra coberta, ciente de que se baseia em uma licença de patente, e o Código-Fonte Correspondente da obra não estiver disponível para qualquer pessoa copiar, gratuitamente e sob os termos desta Licença, através de um servidor de rede publicamente disponível ou outros meios prontamente acessíveis, então você deve (1) fazer com que o Código-Fonte Correspondente esteja assim disponível, ou (2) providenciar para se privar do benefício da licença de patente para esta obra em particular, ou (3) providenciar, de maneira consistente com os requisitos desta Licença, para estender a licença de patente aos destinatários a jusante. "Ciente de que se baseia" significa que você tem conhecimento real de que, se не fosse pela licença de patente, sua transmissão da obra coberta em um país, ou o uso da obra coberta por seu destinatário em um país, infringiria uma ou mais patentes identificáveis naquele país que você tem motivos para acreditar que são válidas.

Se, de acordo com ou em conexão com uma única transação ou arranjo, você transmitir, ou propagar por meio da obtenção de transmissão, uma obra coberta, e conceder uma licença de patente a algumas das partes que recebem a obra coberta autorizando-as a usar, propagar, modificar ou transmitir uma cópia específica da obra coberta, então a licença de patente que você concede é automaticamente estendida a todos os destinatários da obra coberta e obras baseadas nela.

Uma licença de patente é "discriminatória" se não incluir no escopo de sua cobertura, proibir o exercício de, ou for condicionada ao não exercício de um ou mais dos direitos que são especificamente concedidos sob esta Licença. Você não pode transmitir uma obra coberta se for parte de um arranjo com um terceiro que está no negócio de distribuição de software, sob o qual você faz um pagamento ao terceiro com base na extensão de sua atividade de transmissão da obra, e sob o qual o terceiro concede, a qualquer uma das partes que receberiam a obra coberta de você, uma licença de patente discriminatória (a) em conexão com cópias da obra coberta transmitidas por você (ou cópias feitas dessas cópias), ou (b) primariamente para e em conexão com produtos específicos ou compilações que contenham a obra coberta, a menos que você tenha entrado nesse arranjo, ou que a licença de patente tenha sido concedida, antes de 28 de março de 2007.

Nada nesta Licença será interpretado como excluindo ou limitando qualquer licença implícita ou outras defesas à infração que possam estar de outra forma disponíveis a você sob a lei de patentes aplicável.

**12. Nenhuma Renúncia à Liberdade de Outros.**

Se condições forem impostas a você (seja por ordem judicial, acordo ou de outra forma) que contradigam as condições desta Licença, elas не o isentam das condições desta Licença. Se você não pode transmitir uma obra coberta de modo a satisfazer simultaneamente suas obrigações sob esta Licença e quaisquer outras obrigações pertinentes, então, como consequência, você não pode transmiti-la de forma alguma. Por exemplo, se você concordar com termos que o obrigam a coletar um royalty por transmissões futuras daqueles a quem você transmite o Programa, a única maneira de satisfazer ambos os termos e esta Licença seria abster-se inteiramente de transmitir o Programa.

**13. Uso com a Licença Pública Geral Affero GNU.**

Não obstante qualquer outra disposição desta Licença, você tem permissão para vincular ou combinar qualquer obra coberta com uma obra licenciada sob a versão 3 da Licença Pública Geral Affero GNU em uma única obra combinada, e para transmitir a obra resultante. Os termos desta Licença continuarão a se aplicar à parte que é a obra coberta, mas os requisitos especiais da Licença Pública Geral Affero GNU, seção 13, relativos à interação através de uma rede, se aplicarão à combinação como tal.

**14. Versões Revisadas desta Licença.**

A Free Software Foundation pode publicar versões revisadas e/ou novas da Licença Pública Geral GNU de tempos em tempos. Tais novas versões serão semelhantes em espírito à versão atual, mas podem diferir em detalhes para abordar novos problemas ou preocupações.

Cada versão recebe um número de versão distinto. Se o Programa especificar que uma certa versão numerada da Licença Pública Geral GNU "ou qualquer versão posterior" se aplica a ele, você tem a opção de seguir os termos e condições daquela versão numerada ou de qualquer versão posterior publicada pela Free Software Foundation. Se o Programa não especificar um número de versão da Licença Pública Geral GNU, você pode escolher qualquer versão já publicada pela Free Software Foundation.

Se o Programa especificar que um procurador pode decidir quais versões futuras da Licença Pública Geral GNU podem ser usadas, a declaração pública de aceitação de uma versão por esse procurador autoriza permanentemente você a escolher essa versão para o Programa.

Versões posteriores da licença podem lhe dar permissões adicionais ou diferentes. No entanto, nenhuma obrigação adicional é imposta a qualquer autor ou detentor de direito autoral como resultado de sua escolha de seguir uma versão posterior.

**15. Isenção de Garantia.**

NÃO HÁ GARANTIA PARA O PROGRAMA, NA MEDIDA PERMITIDA PELA LEI APLICÁVEL. EXCETO QUANDO DECLARADO DE OUTRA FORMA POR ESCRITO, OS DETENTORES DO DIREITO AUTORAL E/OU OUTRAS PARTES FORNECEM O PROGRAMA "COMO ESTÁ", SEM GARANTIA DE QUALQUER TIPO, SEJA EXPRESSA OU IMPLÍCITA, INCLUINDO, MAS NÃO SE LIMITANDO A, AS GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS DE COMERCIALIZAÇÃO E ADEQUAÇÃO A UM PROPÓSITO ESPECÍFICO. O RISCO TOTAL QUANTO À QUALIDADE E DESEMPENHO DO PROGRAMA É SEU. SE O PROGRAMA SE MOSTRAR DEFEITUOSO, VOCÊ ASSUME O CUSTO DE TODA A MANUTENÇÃO, REPARO OU CORREÇÃO NECESSÁRIA.

**16. Limitação de Responsabilidade.**

EM NENHUM CASO, A MENOS QUE EXIGIDO PELA LEI APLICÁVEL OU ACORDADO POR ESCRITO, QUALQUER DETENTOR DE DIREITO AUTORAL, OU QUALQUER OUTRA PARTE QUE MODIFIQUE E/OU TRANSMITA O PROGRAMA CONFORME PERMITIDO ACIMA, SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PERANTE VOCÊ POR DANOS, INCLUINDO QUAISQUER DANOS GERAIS, ESPECIAIS, INCIDENTAIS OU CONSEQUENCIAIS DECORRENTES DO USO OU DA INCAPACIDADE DE USAR O PROGRAMA (INCLUINDO, MAS NÃO SE LIMITANDO A, PERDA DE DADOS OU DADOS TORNADOS IMPRECISOS OU PERDAS SOFRIDAS POR VOCÊ OU TERCEIROS OU UMA FALHA DO PROGRAMA EM OPERAR COM QUAISQUER OUTROS PROGRAMAS), MESMO QUE TAL DETENTOR OU OUTRA PARTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO DA POSSIBILIDADE DE TAIS DANOS.

**17. Interpretação das Seções 15 e 16.**

Se a isenção de garantia e a limitação de responsabilidade fornecidas acima não puderem ter efeito legal local de acordo com seus termos, os tribunais de revisão aplicarão a lei local que mais se aproxime de uma renúncia absoluta de toda a responsabilidade civil em conexão com o Programa, a menos que uma garantia ou assunção de responsabilidade acompanhe uma cópia do Programa em troca de uma taxa.

**FIM DOS TERMOS E CONDIÇÕES**

**Como Aplicar Estes Termos aos Seus Novos Programas**

Se você desenvolver um novo programa e quiser que ele seja de máxima utilidade para o público, a melhor maneira de conseguir isso é torná-lo um software livre que todos possam redistribuir e alterar sob estes termos.

Para fazer isso, anexe os seguintes avisos ao programa. É mais seguro anexá-los ao início de cada arquivo-fonte para declarar mais eficazmente a exclusão de garantia; e cada arquivo deve ter pelo menos a linha de "copyright" e um ponteiro para onde o aviso completo é encontrado.

> LibraSign - Sistema de Reconhecimento da Língua Brasileira de Sinais
>
> Copyright (C) 2025 Heitor Câmara Costa Fernandes
>
> Este programa é software livre: você pode redistribuí-lo e/ou modificá-lo sob os termos da Licença Pública Geral GNU, conforme publicada pela Free Software Foundation, seja a versão 3 da Licença, ou (a seu critério) qualquer versão posterior.
>
> Este programa é distribuído na esperança de que seja útil, mas SEM QUALQUER GARANTIA; sem mesmo a garantia implícita de COMERCIALIZAÇÃO ou ADEQUAÇÃO A UM PROPÓSITO ESPECÍFICO. Consulte a Licença Pública Geral GNU para mais detalhes.
>
> Você deve ter recebido uma cópia da Licença Pública Geral GNU junto com este programa. Se não, veja [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

Adicione também informações sobre como contatá-lo por correio eletrônico e postal.

Se o programa interage com o terminal, faça com que ele exiba um breve aviso como este quando iniciar em modo interativo:

> LibraSign Copyright (C) 2025 Heitor Câmara Costa Fernandes
>
> Este programa vem com ABSOLUTAMENTE NENHUMA GARANTIA; para detalhes, digite \`show w\`.
>
> Este é um software livre, e você é bem-vindo para redistribuí-lo sob certas condições; digite \`show c\` para detalhes.

Os comandos hipotéticos \`show w\` e \`show c\` devem mostrar as partes apropriadas da Licença Pública Geral. Claro, os comandos do seu programa podem ser diferentes; para uma interface gráfica, você usaria uma "caixa sobre".

Você também deve pedir ao seu empregador (se você trabalha como programador) ou à sua escola, se houver, para assinar uma "isenção de direitos autorais" para o programa, se necessário. Para mais informações sobre isso e como aplicar e seguir a GNU GPL, veja [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

A Licença Pública Geral GNU não permite a incorporação do seu programa em programas proprietários. Se o seu programa for uma biblioteca de sub-rotinas, você pode considerar mais útil permitir a vinculação de aplicativos proprietários com a biblioteca. Se é isso que você quer fazer, use a Licença Pública Geral Menor GNU (Lesser General Public License) em vez desta Licença. Mas primeiro, por favor, leia [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html).
